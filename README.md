# SOEN341

This is a repository created to organize and keep track of our SOEN 341 Project. The Goal is to create a career site resembling Indeed. At the end of the development cycle, there will be complete UX for job seekers, employers and site admins.

### Project Approach and Tech Stack

The Project will be be built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, NodeJS) because of the following reasons:
1. Full-stack JavaScript: All components of the MERN stack use JavaScript, allowing for a seamless development experience.

2. Popularity: MERN is a widely used and well-supported stack, with a large community of developers, making it easy to find resources and support.

3. Scalability: The MERN stack has proven to be scalable, making it a good choice for developing a career site with potential for growth.

4. Speed: React, one of the components of the MERN stack, is known for its fast performance, which is important for a site with a large volume of job postings and candidate profiles.

5. User experience: React and Node.js allow for fast and responsive user interactions, making the site more user-friendly and easy to navigate.
